# Compile the spend circuit and run a TESTBED-ONLY Groth16 setup.
#
#   ./setup.sh                  # compile + ceremony + verifier export
#
# Groth16 needs a circuit-specific trusted setup. This script runs the whole
# ceremony locally with entropy from /dev/urandom, which is fine for a testbed
# and for Sepolia demos but is NOT a production ceremony: whoever runs it
# could keep the toxic waste and forge proofs for themselves. A real
# deployment replaces phase 1 with a public powers-of-tau (e.g. the Hermez
# ceremony file) and runs a multi-party phase 2. Set PTAU=/path/to/final.ptau
# to use an externally sourced phase-1 file.
#
# Outputs (build/ is gitignored except the two committed artifacts):
#   build/spend.r1cs, build/spend_js/spend.wasm   circuit
#   build/spend_final.zkey                        proving key (~8 MB)
#   ../contracts/src/Groth16Verifier.sol          committed, snarkjs-generated
#   ../contracts/vectors/spend_vkey.json          committed verification key
#
# The committed verifier and any committed proof fixtures are mutually
# consistent; re-running this script re-randomises the ceremony, so it also
# regenerates every proof fixture consumer (run ../wallet/gen_smoke.py after).
